Data Gsthering

Usually we come across 4 types of formats

    1. CSV : usually on kaggle we get data in csv formats
    2. Json(Js on notation) / SQL : usually extracted data from api.(universally accepted format)
    3. Fetch data from api (existing api and we can customize data according to our use.)
    4. Web scraping (Restricted access, so scrap data from such websites through  parser.)
