                                                            BIVARIATE Analysis

- NUMERICAL - NUMERICAL
    - Scatterplot 
        ~ sns.scatterplot(tips['col1'],tips['col2'])
- NUMERICAL - CATEGORICAL
    - BarPlot
        ~ Plot x axis on category and y -axis on numerical value.
        ~ sns.barplot(df['col1'],df['col2'])
    - Box Plot
        ~ We could say it allows to plot parallel boxplot.  
        ~ sns.boxplot(df['categorical_col'],df['numerical_col'])
    - Distplot
        ~ sns.distplot(titanic[titanic['Survived']==0]['Age'])   // kde distplot for those who don't survived                                                 
        ~ sns.distplot(titanic[titanic['Survived']==1]['Age'])   // kde distplot for those who  survived                
        If i make it and run in a cell, it amalgamtes both plot and allow efficient comparision.                                 
- CATEGORICAL - CATEGORICAL
    - Crosstab : pd.crosstab(df['class'],df['Survived'])   // it will create a table let i had 3 class(rows) and 2 col (survived or not) -> gives value_count 
    - Heatmap : It is the visualization of this crosstab.
        ~ sns.heatmap(pd.crosstab(df['categorical_col1'],df['cat_col2']))

- NUMERICAL - NUMERICAL
    - Scatterplot 
        ~ sns.scatterplot(tips['col1'],tips['col2'], hue = tips['col3']) //this hue tells the difference             (TRI VARIATE)
            Let I have plotted scatterplot b/w two column between total_bill and tip, now i want to analyze this in terms of gender so hue = df['Gender']
    - Scatterplot 
        ~ sns.scatterplot(tips['col1'],tips['col2'], hue = tips['col3'],style = df['col4']) //this style differentiates           (Quad VARIATE)
            Let I have plotted scatterplot b/w two column between total_bill and tip, now i want to analyze this in terms of gender so hue = df['Gender'], and style = df['Smoker'](whether ther person paying smokes or not), it will differntiate plotting by dot and cross.
    - Scatterplot 
        ~ sns.scatterplot(tips['col1'],tips['col2'], hue = tips['col3'],style = df['col4'], size= df['size']) //this style differentiates           (Multi VARIATE)
            Let I have plotted scatterplot b/w two column between total_bill and tip, now i want to analyze this in terms of gender so hue = df['Gender'], and style = df['Smoker'](whether ther person paying smokes or not), it will differntiate plotting by dot and cross, and size determines how many people were there alonmg that person. (In short comparing 5 cols at a time).
