                            Data understanding / Analysis 

First Questions to ask when you get our data:
    1. How big is the data.
        - df.shape

    2. How does the data look liks? 
        - df.head()
        - df.sample(5) //sometime we gets biased data so to avoid it we can use this function. (It gives 5 random row from whole data, rather than the top or btm ).
    
    3. What is the data type of col
        - df.info()  // if float u can try to change them in int

    4. Are there any missing values and how many
        - can be determined from df.info()
        - df.isnull().sum() 

    5. How does data look numerically?
        - df.describe() //give 5 no summary //only gives summary related to numerical data.

    6. Are there duplicate values?
        - df.duplicated().sum()  //give the no of rows duplicated.

    7.  How is the correlation between cols?
        - df.corr()
        - For correlation of all cols vs specific_col =  df.corr()['col_name']
        - It helps to find how much a column is dependent on other.
        - In ML we are surely comparing it with target.
        - It is usually done multiple times throughout the processs.
